# IOT_SYSTEM
An IOT management to be run locally

The idea behind this project is that of a system for the management of IOT and home automation to be tun locally (on a Raspberry, PC, server, etc.)
This has three main objectives:
- configurability
- privacy
- resilience of systems if network connectivity is patchy/unavailable.
